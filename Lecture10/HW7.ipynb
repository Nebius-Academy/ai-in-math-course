In this problem, we follow the idea from [A Tutorial on the Cross-Entropy Method](https://web.mit.edu/6.454/www/www_fall_2003/gew/CEtutorial.pdf) (pp. 25-27) by de Boer, Kroese, Mannor, and Rubinstein to simply use a Markov chain to generate tours. That is, each next city in a tour will be generated randomly based solely on the current city (as opposed to the entirety of the currently built part of the tour), via a matrix of probabilities.\n","\n","Instead of directly implementing the procedure in the paper, to minimize work, we'll use our current model but replace the RNN+FFNN model with a single linear layer with one-hot input vectors (corresponding to the current city) and output giving scores of the potential next cities. This will correspond (after we apply softmax in the method that builds a tour based on scores) to multiplying by probability matrix. The actual difference with the paper is that they give an explicit formula for updating probabilities, whereas we will just use the optimizer that we already have.\n","\n","Run the cells below to initialize the process.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2NoWazVzrCmb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# instal library for computing exact solution of tsp (a bit faster than bruteforce) and a quick heuristic solution\n","!pip install python-tsp"],"metadata":{"id":"oXBOJW-ciIdI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import networkx as nx\n","import random\n","import math\n","\n","from python_tsp.exact import solve_tsp_dynamic_programming\n","from python_tsp.heuristics import solve_tsp_simulated_annealing\n","\n","import random\n","import numpy as np\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","\n","# Large weight\n","INF_WEIGHT = 10**5"],"metadata":{"id":"gCGy__EyM6F4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Graph generator"],"metadata":{"id":"GQij4uLlNgEs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def generate_graph_with_min_degree_2(num_vertices, prob=0.5):\n","  \"\"\"Generates a graph where each vertex has a degree of at least 2.\"\"\"\n","  graph = nx.Graph()\n","  for i in range(num_vertices):\n","      graph.add_node(i)\n","\n","  #
