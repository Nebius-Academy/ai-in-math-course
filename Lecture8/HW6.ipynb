any assistants, they need supervision. After all, however much you rely on LLMs for coding, you are responsible for the result.\n","\n","To help you a bit, we share some ideas that might improve your experience with LLMs.\n","\n","**Vibe coding guidelines**\n","\n","We'd recommend trying **Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet**, or **ChatGPT o3/o4-mini**, or **Gemini 2.5** - they'll give you the best result. **DeepSeek V3** or **R1** should also work well. A **playground** is a better vibe coding interface than an API, especially because you'll likely need several iterations to polish the code. Unless you use an AI-powered IDE such as **Cursor**, of course.\n","\n","Here are some general prompting guidelines for LLM-assisted coding:\n","\n","1. **Clearly explain which functionality and interface you need**\n","\n","  \"I need a chatbot\" is too vague, and the results will be unpredictable. Describe how the user will be interacting with the chatbot. Explain which parameters to set up in the constructor. Choose whether you want a function or a class and clearly communicate this. Decide how exceptions should be treated.\n","\n","  Some of the LLMs will be all too earger to create many things you don't ask them - a productionalizing framework, a chatbot factory, examples of usage etc. Without proper guidance, they can swamp you in code. To avoid this, you may add very insistently that you only want the chatbot class/function and nothing else.\n","\n","  Since we're working in Jupyter, LLMs may annoy you much by creating usage examples that require command line execution. Explaining how you are going to work with the code might help with that.\n","\n","2. **Provide code examples**\n","\n","  If you're ok with the design of `answer_with_llm` and if you want the new class or function to have a similar interface, provide its implementation. LLMs are usually good at reproducing design patterns.\n","\n","  It's a good practice to highlight code with\n","\n","  ````{verbatim}\n","  ```\n","  <your code>\n","  ```\n","  ````\n","\n","3. **Test LLM's understanding**\n","\n","  I personally like requesting an LLM to ask any questions it had BEFORE (yes, caps won't hurt) it starts generating code. This might help you to steer the LLM into the right direction. From our experience LLMs sometimes ask really good questions here, uncovering things we'd forgotten to think of beforehand.\n","\n","4. **Be ready for several iterations of improvement**\n","\n","  Even if you prompt an LLM really carefully, it may still surprise you. So, though in this task you may grab the first working version, we advise you not to rely blindly on whatever LLMs generate, especially in longer projects, where programming antipatterns might cost you dearly.\n","\n","  From our experience LLMs are reasonably good at writing boilerplate code, but look out for code duplication, hardcoding, and overcomplication."],"metadata":{"id":"0jUo58Bj0p0x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Setting things up\n","\n","Before starting to work, save your Nebius AI Studio API key to a file called `nebius_api_key` (use plain text editor for that to avoid adding rogue characters) and load it to colab."],"metadata":{"id":"j5QALIHlES14"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -q openai"],"metadata":{"id":"WqCgRtIRIcN3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","\n","with open(\"nebius_api_key\", \"r\") as file:\n","    nebius_api_key = file.read().strip()\n","\n","os.environ[\"NEBIUS_API_KEY\"] = nebius_api_key"],"metadata":{"id":"NRpRGdl5IdJZ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We'll be calling APIs quite often in this notebook, so let's define a shortcut fuction to avoid repeating all the code.

(We're only interested in the \"internal\" thinking process.)\n","- Then, solutions are divided into individial \"thoughts\" using the following heuristics:\n","  - `Alternatively`, `Wait`, `But wait`, `But let me check again`, `But let's verify`, and similar phrases mark the starts of new \"thoughts\". Note that they are typical indications of backtracking and solution branching. There may be more, of course.\n","  - Otherwise, a \"thought\" is a continuous range of paragraphs of length not less than `min_split_size` characters (we'll take `min_split_size=120`). Separate-line Latex formulas are always added to the previous thought.\n","- For each \"thought\", its length in tokens is calculated. For that, we need to supply the right **tokenizer** which corresponds to the model which generated the solutions - in our case, **[QwQ-32B-Preview](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview)**. And that's why you needed to create a **Hugging Face access token**. If you haven't done it yet, please register to HF, get the token and load it to colab in a `hf_access_token` file.\n","\n","  If you're ardently against registering to Hugging Face, you can supply `None` as `tokenizer`, but in this case you won't get correct token length of individual \"thoughts\".\n","\n","- The **\"thee of thoughts\"** is constructed in the following way:\n","  - If a \"thought\" starts with `Alternatively`, `Wait`, or `But wait`, we query using another LLM (**Llama-3.1-70B** by default) to determine which of the previous \"thoughts\" is continued by this. If it starts a completely different solution, the thought is connected to **root** (empty solution; the very start).\n","  - Otherwise, the thought is connected with the previous one.\n","\n","- Finally, the tree is saved as `thought_analysis/thought_tree.png`, if you didn't change default output path."],"metadata":{"id":"swHTNC7g79Ji"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -q openai"],"metadata":{"id":"A2yGX-XD47Av"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!curl -o thought_analysis.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/main/topic2/thought_analysis.py"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hMu58cxChOMI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741611770789,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":514,"user":{"displayName":"Stanislav Fedotov","userId":"11530214105785176141"}},"outputId":"636718d0-c71d-46cc-b12d-c47bfb379627"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100 20549  100 20549    0     0  67787      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 68043\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's also download a sample solution for us to work with."],"metadata":{"id":"IwS4qdLbtB15"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!curl -o sample_solution.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/main/topic2/sample_solution.txt"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"s2GczUGFtFCb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741611771203,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":413,"user":{"displayName":"Stanislav Fedotov","userId":"11530214105785176141"}},"outputId":"caf46b29-0c52-4bca-b340-f7a37f99a5b5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","100 11280  100 11280    0     0  37244      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 37227\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from openai import OpenAI\n","from thought_analysis import analyze_solution_thoughts\n","from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n","\n","with open(\"hf_access_token\", \"r\") as file:\n","    hf_access_token = file.read().strip()\n","\n","client = OpenAI(\n","    base_url=\"https://api.studio.nebius.ai/v1/\",\n","    api_key=os.environ.get(\"NEBIUS_API_KEY\")\n",")\n","model = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\"\n","\n","reasoning_model = \"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1\"\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(reasoning_model,\n","                                          hf_access_token=hf_access_token)\n","\n","file_path = \"sample_solution.txt\"  #
