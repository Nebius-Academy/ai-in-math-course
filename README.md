# AI in Mathematics — Lecture Overview

This course explores how modern AI techniques interact with mathematical research and problem solving.

**Lectures:**

- **Lectures 1–4: Introduction & Basic Algorithms**  
  Linear regression, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and core optimization methods.

- **Lecture 5: AI Guiding Mathematical Intuition**  
  Discussion of the *Knot Theory Path* paper, showing how AI can advance mathematics by guiding human intuition.

- **Lectures 6–9: Mathematics as an NLP Problem**  
  Treating mathematical reasoning as a language modeling task. Topics include large language models (LLMs), the Lyapunov function paper, and transformer architectures.

- **Lectures 10–13: Reinforcement Learning in Mathematics**  
  Evolutionary algorithms for mathematical discovery, FunSearch and AlphaEvolve approaches, and the paper *What Makes Math Problems Hard for Reinforcement Learning: A Case Study* (Gukov et al., 2025).
