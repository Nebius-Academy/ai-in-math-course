# AI in Mathematics — Lecture Overview

This course explores how modern AI techniques interact with mathematical research and problem solving.

## Lectures

- **Lectures 1–4: Introduction & Basic Algorithms**  
  Linear regression, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and core optimization methods.

- **Lecture 5: AI Guiding Mathematical Intuition**  
  Discussion of the paper [Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x), showing how AI can advance mathematics by assisting human creativity.

- **Lectures 6–9: Mathematics as an NLP Problem**  
  Treating mathematical reasoning as a language modeling task. Topics include large language models (LLMs), symbolic methods, and transformer architectures.
